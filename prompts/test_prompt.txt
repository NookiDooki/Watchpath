### EXAMPLES ###

#### Input Logs:
2025-03-01 09:12:05 INFO User 'admin' logged in from 192.168.1.10

Your task is to analyze system and network logs and **output only the lines that appear anomalous**.  
You must **not** explain, summarize, or comment on your reasoning.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
1. Review each log line individually.  
2. If the log is **normal**, ignore it completely.  
3. If the log is **anomalous**, output it in the following format:  
<original log> | anomaly_confidence=<number between 1–100>
4. Output nothing else — no headers, explanations, or summaries.  
5. Confidence indicates how sure you are that this line is an anomaly (e.g., 95 means 95% sure).  
6. Maintain the original log line exactly as given.

### CONTEXT ###
Anomalies usually involve:
